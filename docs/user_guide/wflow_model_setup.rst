Model set up basics
===================

This plugin helps you preparing or updating several components of a wflow model such as topography information, landuse, soil or forcing.
The main interactions are available from the HydroMT Command Line Interface and allow you to configure
HydroMT in order to build or update or clip wflow models.

When building or updating a model from command line a
:ref:`model region <https://deltares.github.io/hydromt/preview/user_guide/build_region.html?highlight=region>`; a model setup
configuration (.ini file) with model components and options and, optionally,
a :ref:`data sources <https://deltares.github.io/hydromt/preview/user_guide/get_data.html>`(.yml) file should be prepared.

Here you can find more detailed information about the basics for setting up a Wflow model with HydroMT:

* :ref:`Wflow model components <model_components>`
* :ref:`Wflow configuration (.ini file) <model_config>`
* :ref:`Wflow in- and output files <model_files>`
